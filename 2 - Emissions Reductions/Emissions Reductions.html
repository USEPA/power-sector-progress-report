<h2>Sulfur Dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>)</h2>

<p>SO₂ is a highly reactive gas generated primarily by coal-fired power plants. SO<sub>2</sub> contributes to the formation of acid rain and fine particle (PM₂.₅) pollution and are linked to a number of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.epa.gov/so2-pollution/sulfur-dioxide-basics#effects">adverse effects to human health</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="/node/284908">ecosystems</a>.</p>

<p>The states with the highest emitting sources in 1990 have generally seen the greatest SO₂ emission reductions under the ARP, and this trend continued under CAIR and CSAPR. Most of these states are in the Ohio River Valley and are upwind of the areas the ARP and CSAPR were designed to protect. Reductions under these programs have provided important environmental and health benefits over a large region.</p>

<ul class="normal">
	<li>Under the ARP, CAIR, and CSAPR programs, power plants have significantly lowered SO₂ emissions while electricity generation from these power plants&nbsp;remained relatively stable from&nbsp;2000 through 2023.</li>
	<li>These emission reductions are a result of an overall increase in the environmental effectiveness at affected sources as electric generators installed controls, switched to lower emitting fuels, or otherwise reduced their SO₂ emissions. These trends are discussed further in the <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="4ac16d68-df39-4015-bae3-75bbfc52090c" href="/node/284885">Program Basics</a>&nbsp;section.</li>

<h3>SO₂ Emission Trends<a id="so2/so2emissiontrends" name="so2/so2emissiontrends"></a></h3>

<ul class="normal">
	<li><strong>ARP</strong>: Units in the ARP emitted 647,000 tons of SO<sub>2</sub> in 2023, well below the ARP's statutory annual cap of 8.95 million tons. The ARP sources reduced emissions by 15.1million tons (96 percent) from 1990 levels and 16.6 million tons (96 percent) from 1980 levels.</li>
	<li><strong>CSAPR Programs</strong>: Annual SO<sub>2</sub> emissions from sources in the CSAPR SO<sub>2</sub> programs fell from 7.7 million tons in 2005 to 393,000 in 2023 (95 percent). In 2023, SO<sub>2</sub> emissions were about 1.6 million tons below the regional CSAPR emission budgets (0.91 million in Group 1 and 0.53 million in Group 2); the CSAPR SO<sub>2</sub> annual programs' 2023 regional budgets are 1,372,631 and 597,579 tons for Group 1 and Group 2, respectively.</li>
	<li><strong>Both CSAPR and ARP</strong>: In 2023, the ninth year of operation of the CSAPR SO<sub>2</sub> programs, sources in both the CSAPR SO<sub>2</sub> annual programs and the ARP together reduced SO<sub>2</sub> emissions by 15.1 million tons (96 percent) from 1990 levels (before implementation of the ARP), 10.6 million tons (94 percent) from 2000 levels (ARP Phase II), and 9.6 million tons (94 percent) from 2005 levels (before implementation of CAIR and CSAPR). All ARP and CSAPR sources together emitted a total of 650,000 tons of SO<sub>2</sub> in 2023.</li>

<h2>Annual Nitrogen Oxides (NO<sub>X</sub>)</h2>

<p>Nitrogen oxides (NOₓ) are made up of a group of highly reactive gases that are emitted from power plants and motor vehicles, as well as other sources. NOₓ emissions contribute to the formation of ground-level ozone and fine particle pollution, which cause a variety of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.epa.gov/no2-pollution/basic-information-about-no2#Effects">adverse health effects</a>.</p>

<h3>Overall Results</h3>

<h2>Ozone Season Nitrogen Oxides (NO<sub>X</sub>)</h2>

<p>The CSAPR NOₓ ozone season program was established to reduce interstate transport of air pollution during the ozone season (May 1 – September 30), the warm summer months when ozone formation is highest, and to help eastern U.S. counties attain the 1997 ozone standard. The CSAPR Update NOₓ ozone season program was similarly established to help eastern U.S. counties attain the 2008 ozone standard. On March 15, 2021, EPA finalized the Revised CSAPR Update to further reduce NOₓ emissions from power plants in 12 states. The rule responded to a September 2019 ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, Wisconsin v. EPA, which remanded the 2016 CSAPR Update to EPA for failing to fully eliminate significant contribution to nonattainment and interference with maintenance of the 2008 ozone NAAQS from these states by downwind areas’ attainment dates. In 2023, the “<a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="44472b6c-f394-4efc-8c0c-f18cfac278bb" href="/node/274300">Good Neighbor” plan</a> was finalized to secure significant reductions in ozone-forming emissions of nitrogen oxides (NO<sub>X</sub>) from power plants and industrial facilities. On June 27, 2024, the Supreme Court of the United States granted emergency applications seeking a stay of the Good Neighbor Plan pending judicial review. Since this occurred after the 2023 ozone season was fully processed, this impact will be noticed in next year's report.</p>

<p>Coal combustion is more carbon-intensive than burning natural gas or petroleum for electric power production. Although coal use accounted for 50% of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from the sector, it represented only 16% of the electricity generated in the United States in 2023. Natural gas use accounted for 49% of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/browser/">43% of electricity generation in 2023</a>.</p>

<p>In April of 2024, &nbsp;EPA issued final carbon pollution standards for power plants that set carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) &nbsp;limits for new gas-fired combustion turbines and CO<sub>2</sub> emission guidelines for existing coal, oil and gas-fired steam generating units, securing important climate benefits and protecting public health.. These rules will significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions from existing coal-fired power plants and from new natural gas turbines, ensuring that all long-term coal-fired plants and base load new gas-fired plants control 90% of their carbon pollution.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Mercury</h2>

<p>Hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) emitted by power plants include mercury, acid gases (e.g., hydrochloric acid, hydrofluoric acid), non-mercury metallic toxics (e.g., arsenic, nickel, and chromium) and organic HAPs (e.g., formaldehyde, dioxin/furan). Exposure to these pollutants at certain concentrations and durations can increase chances of neurological and developmental effects, cancer, and reproductive, respiratory, and other health problems.</p>

<p>In 2011, EPA issued the <a href="/node/270969">Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS)</a>, establishing national emission standards for mercury and other hazardous air pollutants for new and existing coal- and oil-fired power plants. The standards were finalized under section 112 of the Clean Air Act. On April 25, 2024, the EPA announced requirements to strengthen and update MATS for power plants, based on an evaluation of the residual risk and technology review (RTR).</p>

<h3>Overall Results</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Mercury and other hazardous air pollutant (HAP) emissions have declined significantly since 2010 estimates. These emission reductions were driven by the installation of new pollution controls and enhancements of existing pollution controls that reduce multiple pollutants. Emissions have also decreased due to operational changes, such as fuel switching and increased generation at natural gas-fired units that emit very little mercury and other HAPs. These trends are discussed further in the <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="4ac16d68-df39-4015-bae3-75bbfc52090c" href="/node/284885">Program Basics</a>&nbsp;section.</li>
